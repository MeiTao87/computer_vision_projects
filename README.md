# Computer vision applications
* pendulum.py has the issue of cannot calculate the angle of the pedunlum when the algorithm fails to detect the pendulum.
* color_circle_detection_angle_distance_calculation is an upgrade version for pendulum tracking, it tracks the color circle and calculate the angle of the pedunlum.
* Multiple object detection

# Sudoku Solver

* Take in an sudoku image or detect sudoku puzzle from video, and solve the puzzle.
* Trained a classifier to recognize digits inside the sudoku puzzle.
* The sodoku solver algorithm used a recursion algorithm (call a function inside the function).
